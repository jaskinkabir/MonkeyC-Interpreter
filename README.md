# MonkeyC-Interpreter

My goal in this project is to help the monkey species acheive greatness.
This is the first ever programming language designed for monkeys, called MonkeyC.

It is an interpreted language with implicit type definition, and the interpreter is written in python.
It's called MonkeyC because of a pun and not because of any relation to the C language.

More info can be found in the basic features file, and what I need to implement can be found in tasks.
